# README for a Python Game

This is a simple game known as "Pig" written in the Python programming language. This game allows you to think of an object's name, and the program asks you questions that can help it guess the object you're thinking of.

## Installation and Execution

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the appropriate version of Python installed on your system. This program is compatible with Python 3 versions.

2. Clone or download the repository onto your system:
    ```
    [git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git](https://github.com/Amirho3einzM/Pig-game.git)
    ```

3. Navigate to the game directory:
    ```
    cd Pig-game
    ```

4. Run the game:
    ```
    python pig.py
    ```

## Game Rules:

1. **Dice Rolling**:
   - Each player has two dice that they roll.
   - If one of the dice is 1, the player's score becomes zero and it's the next player's turn.
   - If both dice show 1, one point is added to all players' scores.

2. **Scoring**:
   - Each player earns points equal to the sum of the dice results.

3. **Extra Rounds**:
   - If both dice show the same number (except for 1), the player can roll again, and their points are added.

4. **Winning**:
   - The player who reaches the predetermined score ceiling at the beginning of the game wins.

5. **Setting Score Ceiling**:
   - The score ceiling is determined by the first player and can be between 10 and 100 points.

6. **Number of Players**:
   - The number of players is between 2 and 4, determined by the first player at the beginning of the game.

With these simple and engaging rules, I hope you'll have a great time playing this entertaining game.
